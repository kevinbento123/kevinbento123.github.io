## Delivering your Project

Your final project is delivered in two components: a report and your code.

### My Report! 

Your report should be **delivered via your website**. Submit a link to your website on BruinLearn so that your instructor can browse it to find your report. 

To make this simple, you can write the report using a word processor or Latex, then export it as a .pdf file and upload it to the `assets` directory. You can then link to it [like so](/assets/project_demo.pdf). However, you can also type the report directly onto the website using another markdown page - [here is](/project.md) a template for that.

### My Code! 

A link to your code must be submitted on BruinLearn, and the course instructor must be able to download your code to mark it. The code could be in a Google Colab notebook (make sure to *share* the notebook so access is set to **Anyone with the link**), or you could upload the code into a separate GitHub repository, or you could upload the code into the `assets` directory of your website and link to it.
